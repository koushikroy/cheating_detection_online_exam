# Cheating Detection in Online Exam
Our goal is to detect cheating in online exam through behavioral analysis by processing facial and eye movements from webcam videos. 

# Workflow
  1. To analyze the existing systems that are already in place for online exam cheating detection
  2. Finding out their input mechanisms and how complex those are to implement in real case scenarios
  3. Case study on the reliability and complexity of the preexisting systems aimed for a similar class of application output
  4. Figuring out ways on how we can improve upon those yet simplifying the approach so that everyone can use that with no or minimal additional equipment upgrade
  5. Making a usable system that can work only using the webcam as a primary input source
  6. System will capture facial features such as head pose, eye gaze, etc. and be able to detect any anomaly and then alert the respective authority 
  7. To analyze the effect or contribution of each input feature for the overall outcome that we seek to obtain from our study
  8. Making presentable infographics and tables containing results and comparisons data

# Expected Outcome
Implementation of a reliable and generalizable cheating detector for online exam with no or minimal additional equipment. Analyzing existing methods and finding out their shortcomings along with their limitation.
